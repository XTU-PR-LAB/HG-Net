***********************************
SYNCHRONIZING AND PROJECTING FRAMES
***********************************
Since the RGB and Raw Depth frames are not produced synchronously, (a) they must
be aligned in time and (b) the depth must be projected into the RGB image plane.
The functions get_synched_frames.m and get_projected_depth.m have been provided
to provide this functionality. 

File demo_synched_projected_frames.m provides a visualization of this process.

*************************
RETRIEVING THE ACCEL DATA
*************************
To compile the get_accel_data function, you must alter compile.m with the
absolute location of the libFreenect include directory. Once compile,
get_accel_data.mex* can be called to extract the accelerometer data from the 
*.a files in each scene dump directory.

*******************
Running unit tests:
*******************
To run the unit tests, you need the matlab xUnit framework on your path. It 
can be found here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846

Once xunit is on your path, you can run the tests as follows:

>> cd [TOOLBOX_DIR]
>> runtests
